    "\n",
    "So far, we've computed all our efficiencies using ground truth as provided by our simulation to categorize our signal and background reconstructed electrons.  If we trust our simulation to perfectly describe the detector response, then our job is done.  We cannot do that (**Q: why might we need to know true electron tagging efficiency in data?**), so we need to measure the efficiency in data, categorizing signal and background by inference.  How do we do this without selection bias?  Thanks to the Z boson, we have a solution: tag one electron in an event that passes some high quality requirement, then look for a \"probe\" electron such that the invariant mass of the di-electron pair ($m_{ee}$) matches that of the Z boson.  If we count the number of probes falling in some mass window that pass and fail our ID, we can infer the true electron tagging efficiency in data, despite not knowing the ground truth for each electron.\n",
    "Below is a basic example of making a tag and probe selection, then plotting the pass and fail mass distributions, for POG cut-based electron ID, using our simulated Z event sample."
